# Jupyter notebooks solving various tasks in various mathematical software frameworks

## Purpose
I get a lot of questions on how to do solve certain tasks in various
frameworks. In the hope that these answers also may benefit others, I decided
to put them here.

## List of notebooks
* `equal_support_pm.ipynb`: How to check whether two polyhedral fans have the
  same support in `polymake`.
* `edges_jl.ipynb`: How to work with the edges of a polytope in `Julia` via
  `Polymake.jl`.
* `edges_pm.ipynb`: How to work with the edges of a polytope in `polymake`.
* `simplicial_faces_jl.ipynb`: How to get the number of simplicial faces of a
  polytope in `Julia`.
* `symmetric_fans_jl.ipynb`: How to work with polyhedral fans with a group
  action in `Julia` via `Oscar.jl`.
* `tropical_hypersurface_pm.ipynb`: Pitfalls when checking whether a point is
  contained in a tropical hypersurface in `polymake`.
